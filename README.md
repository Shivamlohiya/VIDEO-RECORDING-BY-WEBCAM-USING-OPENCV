# VIDEO-RECORDING-BY-WEBCAM-USING-OPENCV

This project captures and records live video from your webcam using **OpenCV**. It demonstrates how to access video streams, encode frames, and save them as video files in real time ‚Äî a foundational skill for building surveillance systems, video diaries, and motion tracking applications.

## üìå Project Overview

Recording video from a webcam is a common task in computer vision and multimedia applications. This project shows how to use OpenCV to capture frames, encode them using a video codec, and save the output to disk in `.avi` format.

## üöÄ Features

- Captures live video from webcam
- Records and saves video in real time
- Displays live feed while recording
- Configurable frame size and frame rate
- Clean exit and resource release on key press
